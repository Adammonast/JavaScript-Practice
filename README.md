> This repository contains all my review into the basics of JavaScript

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

This repository is useful for any developer looking to review the essentials of JavaScript. Within the each file are fully built-out examples with comments thoroughly explaning what each piece of the code is doing. I created and utilized this project for the introduction to JavaScript portion of the Lambda School curriculum.

Future plans for this project include: adding code challenges with test files to further practice this material.
